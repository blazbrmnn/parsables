Texts are mainly fun for those who have learned to write well, creating a bunch of documents along the way. Future has been sneaking up on us web developers for a while now, thus it might make sense to ask ourselves a few basic questions yet again.

How to render text documents in browser as a tree of interactive components? How to extract and manipulate data from common, structured text formats, reusing the simplicity that JSX reactive components have come to offer?

It's a challenge that resource-based economy has to overcome. Wait, what? Well, if you're not a serious law offender you probably know the data you hold better than anybody else out there. Still, though, it appears very likely that you wouldn't share everything piece of literal data with everyone - and that includes your shopping list, too. Retaining validated, indexed data in your own possession to get the most out of it is a real challenge.

A challenge on a personal level is to keep track of your data, getting it aggregated and abstracted for future reference just in time. Luckily enough, the majority of people out there conform to common conventions, so converting a text document that's formatted in CommonMark to a tree of components that are rendered to HTML shouldn't be too far-fetched.

Can you do that? Let me see how.
